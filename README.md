# 🎬 YouTube Clone (HTML + CSS)

This is a **frontend-only clone of the YouTube homepage UI**, created using **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of this project was to practice layout design, spacing, styling, and responsive structure (to some extent) after learning the basics of web development.

> ✅ This is my first major web development project!
